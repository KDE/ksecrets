= ksecrets_store design notes

== File format

The file format strives to be multi-platform compatible. The file format is
controlled by the class KSecretsFile. That class is responsible to write bytes
to disk and get them back into memory. So endian stuff should be handled
there. However, most of the contents is serialized in text format - see below
- so the work needed for this endian-ness stuff is quite limited.

TODO finish the endian-related stuff in the class KSecretsFile. At the time of
this writing, the file format is only tested on Intel architecture. Later
it'll be tested on Android, but that's also little-endian.

Serialization is managed by the SecretEntity class in conjunction with the
CryptBuffer class. Serialization is done in text mode and so it's not sensible
to different endian architectures.
