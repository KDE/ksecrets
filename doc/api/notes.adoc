== Notes about the KSecrets API

The communication between the API libraray and the ksecretsd should be
encrypted, to reduce the attack surface, as the dbus traffic can be spied.

The collections are already stored in a encrypted form on disk and they are
typically handled only by one application. So, instead of decrypting the
collection in ksecrets then re-encrypt them for dbus forwarding, the API will
obtain the entire raw-encrypted collection and will handle it directly.
