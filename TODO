There's still plenty of things to do (assorted, incomplete):
- unit-tests for backends (important)
- (unit-)tests for frontends
- fd.o Secrets client API
- adapt KWallet client API
- a backend based on the kwl file-format
- ACLs for determining which applications are allowed to access the
  secrets (per-collection should be fine, probably based on information from
  /proc)
- ways to implement calls that require used-interaction (authorization)
- devising a new file-format that supports the features of the D-Bus API
- do Prompt objects need a maximum lifetime? It seems misbehaving clients could just
  create a lot of them and neither execute nor dismiss them
- see also TODO's in other subdirectories
- use IMAP as a place-holder to centrally store secrets file
- Firefox plugin
