ClientLib
    
    ClientLib aims to replace the KWallet interface

    It'll not be considered complete if it'll not have test
    cases for all the calls

KWallet class rewriting

    KWallet class will be rewritten so existing applications start using KSecretsService
    Ideally, KWalletManager tool should work (but this is not sure)

KSecretsExplorer

    This new GUI will supersede KWalletManager

KSecretSync

    Tool to synchronize secrets accross several devices

NOTE the ordering of release for KSecretSync and KSecretsExplorer is not yet sure
