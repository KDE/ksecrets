/**
 * Secrets storage for KSecrets Service.
 *
 * This class would store the secrets into an underlying custom formated file.
 *
 * Each API call is stateless. That is, the secrets file will always be left in a consistent
 * state between calls. So, even if your application crashes, the file won't get corrupted.
 *   FIXME is that OK? Further tests should be confirm if a background sync
 *   should be introduced in order to get operations faster. However, today computing power do
 *   not justify Ã  priori optimizations, so this first version would modify the file
 *   with each API call.
 * That guarantees client applications that edits are always synced to disk/storage.
 *
 * The API calls are organized in classes, following the structure of data in the store.
 * Applications will first work with a Collection, the search or insert Items into it.
 * The Item class holds, sure enough, the secret value but also let applications associate
 * the secret value with metadata, such as the label or other custom properties.
 *
 * Before using a collection, the application should setup it.
 * It's possible to indicate if readonly mode is possible. That would be the prefered way of
 * accessing the store, as usually applications only need some previously entered password.
 * The setup operation fails if the readonly flag is given and if the secrets file is not found.
 *
 * When setting-up without readonly flag, the file is created if not found, then the file is exclusively locked. The lock is
 * released when the class is destroyed. You should keep the file locked as shortly as
 * possible, in order to avoid deadlocks between applications that also need to read the
 * secrets. For more information @see setup().
 *
 * The data are encrypted using libgcypt and the algorythm Twofish which is the fasted for this library.
 *
 * TODO give here a code example once the API stabilizes
 *
 * @note All const members in this interface are thread-safe.
 *
 * @note Why is this a class and not a namespace?
 *       The underlying storage should be kept locked as briefly as possible.
 *       By providing a class, one could use local variables and the class
 *       would be destroyed, releasing the file, upon block exit.
