KSecretsService client API
==========================

This folder contains the client API of the KSecretsService infrastructure.
KDE applications are supposed to use this API when storing/retrieving their secrets.
Behind the scenes, this API will connect whatever service on the DBus implements the freedesktop.org secrets API.
On a KDE environment, this would be ksecretsd but gnome-keyring is also known for implementing this API.
